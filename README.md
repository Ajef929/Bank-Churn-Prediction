# Bank Churn Prediction

This repository consists of a python script to perform machine learning as well as an R markdown report to achieve an equivalent analysis. 
To view the entire analysis process, open the bank_churn_prediction html file in a browser.
The python script performs a very similar analysis, outputting charts stored in the Graphs folder.

The dataset used comes from a kaggle competition. See https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hj5992/bank-churn-modelling

The goal of this project was to predict whether or not an unseen customer is likely to be retained.
